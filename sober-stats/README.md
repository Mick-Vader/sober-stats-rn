# Welcome to Sober Stats

This is a React Native app built through Expo using Tailwind CSS (and NativeWind) to help people wanting to embark on a sober journey see some cool stats about their campaign so far

This will be a simple app by design using a minimalist approach and will incorporate only minor configuration options such as setting the default number of drinks consumed on an average session, how much on average those drinks would cost and how often the user would go drinking per week

These stats will help showcase the other benefits of going sober from alcohol aside from the obvious health benefits. I am also making this app completely unlicensed using The Unlicense as it should be used, modified, or published by anyone. It's a simple app for the greater good. I hope you enjoy it
